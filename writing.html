              Clear communication is essential for building influence, yet we often underestimate its power. Writing brings clarity, while storytelling inspires and moves people.

            <h3>Blurry Facts</h3>
            <p>I was born with severe astigmatism. Everything in my sight was blurry—that was simply how I knew the world to be. Life was a series of distorted images, blended colors, and softness. But when I got my first pair of glasses at age three, I finally saw the world with clarity. My life shifted from a hazy dream to hard-edged reality.</p>
            <p>I hated my glasses, especially at school. No one my age wore them. Kids would snatch them off my face, trying them on while mocking me—calling me old, a nerd, a weirdo, or blind. I was also slower than the other kids, having grown accustomed to moving carefully because of my poor vision. This only made my parents more overprotective.</p>
            <p>I was, in many ways, pathetically sheltered. Strapping on Velcro shoes felt like a puzzle—I never had to do it myself because my nanny always did it for me. Playing outside gave me grotesque hives, so I was forced to stay indoors, entertaining myself with Barbie dolls.</p>
            <p>But my childhood wasn’t bad. I was a suburban Californian girl with a full-time nanny who cooked for me, fed me, fanned me in the summer heat, and did whatever I asked. Yet, as I grew older and saw the world more clearly, I also saw my life for what it was.</p>
            <p>It had no substance. </p>

            <h3>Dear Memories</h3>
            <p>Rain reminds me of my youth. As a toddler, I would sit snug in my car seat, watching droplets splatter intricate patterns across the window. The sky, a pale gray canvas, was speckled with twinkling diamonds of water. In the background, my parents played a shuffle of soft early-2000s ballads.</p>
            <p>The scent of rain, the velvety touch of the car seat, the delicate rhythm of falling droplets, and the soothing melodies all blended into a lullaby that carried me into a deep sleep. It’s a memory I’ve tucked away in a sacred corner of my mind—a feeling I long for, one that only comes alive on rainy days.</p>

            <h3>Undergrad</h3>
            <p>I have always been a dreamer, unafraid to create. As a child, I glued together scraps of trash and folded old math homework into abstract origami, fascinated by the three-dimensional world. This curiosity led me to pursue industrial design.</p>
            <p>At Pratt’s industrial design program, my freshman year was a rigorous foundation in skills and technique. Like a sponge, I absorbed digital software tools, eager to explore their possibilities.</p>
            <p>By junior year, I set my sights on an ambitious idea: allowing humans to swim in air. Treadmills let us run indoors in small spaces, but swimming requires an entire pool—costly and difficult to maintain. I wanted to create a swimming simulator that offered the benefits of the low-impact sport while keeping users dry. The only problem? This product didn’t exist—yet.</p>
            <p>That year, I balanced schoolwork with an internship at a furniture design studio near Chinatown. Passing by the seafood stalls daily, I observed how fish and shellfish moved through water. Their elegant motions sparked an idea: what if a swimming simulator could mimic the fluidity of marine life? I took home a lobster, five shrimp, and clams—not just for dinner, but for research. Boiling and disassembling them, I studied their structures and incorporated their mechanics into a sketch model. Inspired by biomimicry, I combined the natural movements of shellfish with the water resistance mechanisms of rowing machines.</p>
            <p>That semester of pure imagination and exploration is something I will never take for granted.</p>

            <h3>I Don't Know</h3>
            <p>Everything is essentially a lie. Everything we see or believe is simply an abstraction of the reality we have created in our own head to give us a peace of mind.</p>
            <p>The truth is something creative, not factual or logial</p>
            <p>We can create our own truth. The truth is malleable. </p>
